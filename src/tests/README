Test-scripts for varnishtest
============================

Naming scheme
-------------

        The intent is to be able to run all scripts in lexicographic
        order and get a sensible failure mode.

        This requires more basic tests to be earlier and more complex
        tests to be later in the test sequence, we do this with the
        prefix/id letter:

                [id]%05d.vtc

        id ~ ^a         --> VMOD internal errors 
        id ~ ^b         --> Basic functionality tests
        id ~ ^c         --> Complex functionality tests
        id ~ ^g         --> GZIP tests
        id ~ ^t         --> Transport protocol tests
