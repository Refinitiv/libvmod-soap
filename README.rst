vmod-soap
============

SYNOPSIS
========

import soap;

DESCRIPTION
===========

SOAP vmodule for Varnish 4 and 5. libvmod-soap aims to read SOAP basic elements in HTTP request body (action, uri, and/or using xpath) and allow users to do routing in VCL based on these values.

FUNCTIONS
=========

<In progress>

INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the ``varnishtest`` tool.

Building requires the Varnish header files and uses pkg-config to find
the necessary paths.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure

If you have installed Varnish to a non-standard directory, call
``autogen.sh`` and ``configure`` with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing to
the appropriate path. For instance, when varnishd configure was called
with ``--prefix=$PREFIX``, use

::

 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig
 export ACLOCAL_PATH=${PREFIX}/share/aclocal

The module will inherit its prefix from Varnish, unless you specify a
different ``--prefix`` when running the ``configure`` script for this
module.

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod.
* make install - installs your vmod.
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``.
* make distcheck - run check and prepare a tarball of the vmod.

If you build a dist tarball, you don't need any of the autotools or
pkg-config. You can build the module simply by running::

 ./configure
 make

Installation directories
------------------------

By default, the vmod ``configure`` script installs the built vmod in the
directory relevant to the prefix. The vmod installation directory can be
overridden by passing the ``vmoddir`` variable to ``make install``.

USAGE
=====

In your VCL you could then use this vmod along the following lines::

        import soap;

        sub vcl_recv {
                set req.http.soap-action = soap.action();
        }

COMMON PROBLEMS
===============

* configure: error: Need varnish.m4 -- see README.rst

  Check whether ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` and ``ACLOCAL_PATH`` were set correctly
  before calling ``autogen.sh`` and ``configure``
